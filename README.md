# FJS-Q4XP-smartCopilot

A WIP config file for [smartCopilot v4](https://sky4crew.com/smartcopilot) and the [FJS Q4XP](https://www.flyjsim.com/q4xp).

### Prior to connecting
- Ensure standby radio frequencies are matched (or simply set to 118.0 for VHF, 100 for ADF, transponder set to 2000).

### Known Issues
- Pitot static isolation valve does not work.
- Throttles can only be controlled with throttle up and throttle down keys (F1, F2).

### Data that cannot be shared due to A/C limitations
- Standby radio frequencies cannot be shared.
